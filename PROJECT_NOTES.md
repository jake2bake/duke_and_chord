## What I learned about the codebase: 
    It's modularized for following the principle of singular responsibility, but it's older cold and therefore contains some deprecation necessitating adjustment for optimal use in newer browsers. It uses HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. 

## How AI assistance changed my workflow: 
    I was able to familiarize myself with the codebase more quickly, construct new features, and enable optimal performance more efficiently. I generally like working alone, but the additional help AI provides as a check and quick reference is great. My debugging is faster and, with additional context, more accurate. 

## Where I needed to correct or refine suggestions: 
    I didn't need to correct the code as much as I needed to provide more context. The code looks good to me, but the issues I chose to work on weren't very complicated and the project itself is pretty simple. I think it understood the project very well, and I was surprised at the inferences it could make based on the codebase when helping me with the issues I was working on. 

## Verifying AI-generated code: 
    I asked it clarification questions and also asked if there were better options compared to its suggestions. If it could produce alternate options, I'd ask which was better and why. I'd also implement in steps and not let it have free rein. Once the code was finished, I'd test it in the browser and proceed from there. For instance, there were edge cases and different tests I needed to run for the second issue I completed, issue #2, that I may have missed, but I made sure to ask the LLM about these so I could get as much right as quickly as I could. It really helped me out there and saved some time.
