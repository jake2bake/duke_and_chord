## What I learned about the codebase: 
    It's modularized for following the principle of singular responsibility, but it's older cold and therefore contains some deprecation necessitating adjustment for optimal use in newer browsers. It uses HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. 

## How AI assistance changed my workflow: 
    I was able to familiarize myself with the codebase more quickly, construct new features, and enable optimal performance more efficiently.

## Where I needed to correct or refine suggestions: 
    The LLM didn't make any mistakes; I just wasn't clear enough or provide enough context in some of my prompts. 

## Verifying AI-generated code: 
    I asked it clarification questions and also asked if there were better options compared to its suggestions. If it could produce alternate options, I'd ask which was better and why. I'd also implement in steps and not let it have free rein. Once the code was finished, I'd test it in the browser and proceed from there.
